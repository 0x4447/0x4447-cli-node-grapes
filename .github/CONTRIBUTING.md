# How to contribute

We take very seriously the code quality and code style in our repositories. Before you contribute make sure you did read the [company guidelines](https://github.com/0x4447/0x4447-The-Library/tree/master/Blueprints/programmer), where we describe how to code, behave, and use this GitHub account.

No exception will be made.
