# üçá Grapes

We created the Grapes CLI tool after experiencing increasing frustration as we worked with a massive CloudFormation file. While what AWS CloudFormation do amazed us, working withn one gigantic file became too labor intensive and prone to errors. At that point, we decided to create Grapes.

Grapes gave us the ability to break down the entire CloudFormation file structure into smaller chunks, which made it much easier to reason out issues and work with the file.

We hope you'll find Grapes useful, too!

# How to Install

```
] sudo npm install -g @0x4447/grapes
```

# How to Use

```
] grapes -b -s .
```

# Where to get Help

```
] grapes -h
```

# What to Expect

### Build

Expect a `CloudFormation.json` file appear in the folder that you pointed using the `-s` parameter. The file will contain the final CloudFormation file that you can upload straight to AWS for deployment.

### Init

Expect a complete folder structure in the path that you specifie in the CLI. THe end result is the exact structure that Graps expects when building the final file. Do not change the folder name, while the file name is irrelevant. Make sure the files are proper JSON files.
