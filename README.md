# üçá Grapes

This CLI tool was created after the incresing frustration while working on massive CloudFormation file. What AWS did is amazing, but the way you work on the file is to labour intensive and prone to mistakes. That is why we decided to find a solution and made this tool.

By braking donw the whole CloudFormation structure in to smaller chunks it made it much easier to reazon about, and keep our sanity in check.

We hope that Grapes will make your wokr with CloudFormation much easier.

Expect a `CloudFormation.json` file appear in the folder that you pointed using the `-s` parameter. The file will contain the final CloudFormation file that you can upload straight to AWS for deployment.
